# HowTo
## Install 3rd-party packages
Use the list of packages from `requirements.txt` to prepare your environment:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Print help
Simply call the `main.py` script without any arguments to print the help message:
```python
python3 main.py
```

## Inject profiler decorators
The code injects decorators in front of the functions that should be profiled.
Therefore, the user should specify the function (and the class) name, the file where
the function is defined, and the name of the project to which the file belongs to.
Here is an example call:
```python
python3 main.py -f factorial.py -p examples -n taylor_exp -t cpu
```
Execution of the line above will perform the following steps:
1. create a working copy of the package `example`
2. add a decorator that corresponds to the `cpu` profiler to the `taylor_exp`
function in the `factorial.py` file

After the call, go to the directory with a working copy and execute your scripts 
as usual. Don't forget to modify `PYTHONPATH` to let `python` know that the directory 
with `decoProf` exists:
```python
PYTHONPATH="${PWD}/..:$PYTHONPATH" python3 factorial.py
```

If the function of interest is a member function of a class, then the class name 
should be prepended to the function name and separated by `.` (dot), e.g. `className.functionName` 

Note that the working copy has a unique name based on the time stamp and is not deleted after 
execution of `main.py`.

## Profilers
At the moment, only four profilers are available. The types and the corresponding `-t` options are 
listed in the table below:

| Profiler         |     -t     |                     Notes                                     |
|------------------|:----------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|
| cProfile         |    cpu     |       Default CPU profiler, a bit slow (deterministic)        |
| pyinstrument     | call_stack |    Report the call stack and elapsed times (statistical)      |
| yappi            |   thread   | Allows to profile multi-threaded applications (deterministic) |
| memory_profiler  |    mem     |                Memory profiler                                |


### What are "deterministic" and "statistical" profilers?

#### Deterministic
Deterministic profilers work by hooking into several function call/leave events and calculate all metrics according to these. 

#### Statistical
Statistical profilers do not track every function call the program makes but they record the call stack every 1ms or whatever defined in the interval. The statistical profilers can impose less overhead compared to the deterministic ones.
